# RNN-LSTM Visualizer

An interactive web-based application to visualize the hidden states of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This project demonstrates how memory evolves over time in sequence models using numerical time-series input.

## Features
- Supports RNN and LSTM models
- Visualizes hidden states using heatmaps
- Step-by-step memory inspection
- Adjustable hidden units
- Download hidden states as CSV
- Clean and professional web interface

## Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch
- Streamlit
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

## How to Run
```bash
pip install torch streamlit numpy matplotlib pandas
streamlit run app.py
